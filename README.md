Git Repository for developing LearnR lessons for reinforcing ANOVA analysis in R, with a specific process in mind.

Lessons include:

* An overview of the process: `anova_process`.
* An example using the process where there is a significant difference: `ex_basic_sig_diff`.
* An example using the process where there is *not* significant difference: `ex_basic_no_difference`.
* An example with heteroscedastic data: `ex_heterosc`.
* An example where we need to log the response variable: `ex_logoutcome`.
